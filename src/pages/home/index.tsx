                Hi! My name is Jung Ho Kwon, but you can call me John. I love
                finding ways to use my skills as a programmer to make life
                easier for everybody. I first started coding Minecraft plugins
                for servers as a hobby, and it quickly grew into an interest
                that I would later pursue in university (CSUN) as a computer
                science major.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I also have a huge passion for music. As a music producer, I
                have collaborated with many artists across all genres (except
                country), all over the world. I am credited on over 60 songs and
                have a total of more than 15 million streams.
              </p>
